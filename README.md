# Patron

__Patron__ is a template engine for PHP5.3+. It facilitates a mangeable way to seperate application
logic and content from its presentation. Templates are usually written in HTML and include keywords
that are replaced as the template is parsed, and special markups that control the logic of the
template or fetch data.

A typical example:

```html
<p:articles limit="10">
	<p:foreach>
		<h1>#{@title}</h1>
		
		<div class="article-body">#{@=}</div>
		
		<p:if test="@comments">
			<h2>User comments</h2>
		
			<p:foreach in="@comments">
				<h3>Comment â„–#{self.position} by #{@author}</h3>

				<div class="comment-body">#{@=}</div>
			</p:foreach>
		</p:if>
	</p:foreach>
	
	<p:pager range="self.range" />
</p:articles>
```

### Features
